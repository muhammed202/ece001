    <td>distinguished by the fact that they only include the orders that the computer understands and thus is the language that is more distant from  The language that a person understands, but at the same time it allows the programmer to have complete control of the programming, and the other type is the high-level programming language, which is the language that is farthest from the language of the machine and closest to understanding the human being, but it also does not allow the same amount of control that low-level languages allow the programmer to do so in a soft way.  E organization of computer memory and evidence, but the level is characterized Please choose a is to enable the programmer to use variables and objects in addition to Routines and implementation of large orders in just one line like Python language and Ruby</td>
    <td>Depending on the way it is implemented, programming languages can be divided in terms of the way it is implemented into two types, the first of which is the translated or converted programming language, and the other type is the programming language, interpreted first, the translated programming language, which is a language in which the compiler program is used to be converted into a programming language intended for the operating system and in the form of a program that can  Executing it by calling its name. If the operation was done from the Linux operating system, for example, the user will not be able to run the program on Windows, for example. Examples of this type of programming language are language C. Second, the programming language is used. The interpreter program is used to execute the program.  Directly without the need for translation if the texts are executed by the self-interpreter program, so the interpreter program must be implemented on any device that wants to run the program written on it, which makes this type of program executable on any operating system as long as the interpreted program is installed on it features of the interpreted programming language the ability of the programmer  I have to directly modify the program without the need to translate it, so it is slow to compare it with converted programs. Examples of this type are Python programming language</td>
    <td>Depending on the usage, the programming language can be divided according to the purpose of its use. There is a programming language dedicated to developing and creating websites. Examples include JavaScript, PHP, and Python, and there is another language that can be used in developing mobile phone applications such as Java, Swift, and there is also a language used in developing  Desktop computer software such as Java language and C language. There is also a programming language used to develop video games, such as Java language and C language, and finds a programming language specialized in dealing with the data as R language and Python language</td>
