A computer is a computer device used for the processing of data under computer program control.
And knowing that the computer deals with anything that is in the language of 1 and 0, it converts any inputs for it to that language in order to understand the matter or something else. 
 Program is an instruction sequence, along with data Bottom line Programming is the process in which a programmer writes a code that represents a set of commands that in turn are implemented on a computer device.
 A programming language is a special language that is used by programmers to write software or scripts or another set of commands to be executed on a computer
C language: It is a high-level programming language of general use, created in the seventies of the last century in laboratories  Bell by Dennis Ritchie It is an ideal language for writing fixed and mobile programs. Python is an interpreted, object-oriented programming language that is easy to learn and has little complexity, in addition to the ability to run its programs on several operating systems.
  The Java language is a high-level programming language of general use, in addition to being object oriented, it was created by Sun Microsystems in 1991 AD and is currently subject to Oracle after the latter purchased Sun in 2009.  According to a statistic from Oracle, at the present time, there are more than 9 million programmers that use the Java language. 
 C ++ is a high-level programming language of general use, characterized by being very similar to the C language, but it also supports object-oriented programming, which the programmer can take advantage of or programming in the regular C language without the need to adhere to object-oriented programming
